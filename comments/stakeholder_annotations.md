## Objective 

Direct users through an SMP-native painpoint/stakeholder annotation process that allows them to respond to map content. 

The raw response data for each annotation is stored in triples like this:

| Subject | Predicate | Object |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| annotation IRI | creator | joe.bloggs@example.com |
| annotation IRI | hasTarget | stakeholder/painpoint IRI |
| annotation IRI | hasBody | "Some comment text" |
| annotation IRI | hasCategory | "Surprising" |

This is aggregated into an ouput .csv with the following format:

| Commented By (email) | Comment | Category | Stakeholder/Painpoint | Stakeholder Name | Painpoint Name |
|----------------------|---------|----------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| joe.bloggs@example.com | "Some comment text" | Suprising | Painpoint | A stakeholder | A painpoint |

## Process

### Defining Categories

Annotation categories can be defined per map from the map data sheets.
Example below assumes a new "Annotation Categories" sheet is added with the following structure:

| Name | Icon Url | Selected Icon Url | Help Text | Uses Mask | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Interesting | //host.com/icon.svg | //host.com/inverse.svg | I find this interesting because... | true | Interesting category description |
| Question | //host.com/icon.svg | //host.com/inverse.svg | I have a question... | 1 | Question category description |

This is then transformed into RDF through an annotation categories transform.

```
[
    {
        'sheet': 'Annotation Categories',
        'lets': {
            'iri': 'vm:AnnotationCategory/{row[Name].as_slug}',
        },
        'triples': [
            ('{iri}', 'rdf:type', 'vm:AnnotationCategory'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:name', '{row[Name].as_text}'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:hasIcon', '{row[Icon Url].as_text}'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:hasAltIcon', '{row[Selected Icon Url].as_text}'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:useMask', '{row[Uses Mask].as_json}'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:display', '{row[Help Text].as_text}'),
            ('{iri}', 'vm:description', '{row[Description].as_text}'),
        ],
    }
]
```

E.g. output in Turtle format:
```
<http://visual-meaning.com/rdf/AnnotationCategory/interesting> a vm:AnnotationCategory ;
    vm:description "Interesting category description" ;
    vm:display "I find this interesting becauseâ€¦" ;
    vm:hasAltIcon "//host.com/icon-inverse.svg" ;
    vm:hasIcon "//host.com/icon.svg" ;
    vm:name "Interesting" ;
    vm:useMask "true" .
```

`Uses Mask` signifies whether icons should be used as a CSS masks, or as simple background images.
CSS masks allow the icons to have branded colors, but come with the drawback that only the alpha values are considered when applying. This essentialy makes masked icons monochrome - opaque areas have the brand primary color applied, while fully transparent ones end up being white. Everything in between is a mix of primary and white.

#### Maps with no categories

Maps which do not need different annotation categories can still enable commenting by defining a single row in the "Annotation Categories" sheet.
Example below uses the default comment icons.

| Name | Icon Url | Selected Icon Url | Help Text | Uses Mask | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Comment | //opatlas-live.s3.amazonaws.com/icons/Comment-Mask.svg | //opatlas-live.s3.amazonaws.com/icons/Comment-Inverse-Mask.svg |  | true | The default comment category |

### User identity

A user is authorised to access a map by including their email address (or a wildcarded version of it) in the whitelist for the map's project.

The user is emailed a link to the map. When they access it, they are first prompted to enter their email email. This is checked against the whitelist for access, and will also be used as their identity for entering annotations.

### Explaining the exercise to user

When the user accesses the map for the first time, they are greeted with an Introduction splash outlining the exercise and explaining how to leave annotations (categories and comments) on painpoints/stakeholders.

### Leaving annotations

Clicking on a painpoint brings up the annotation interface. A user can assign a category to a painpoint (Interesting/Surprising etc.) and optionally include a comment. (Emptystring if not entered?)

The painpoint annotation data goes into the UserMapAnnotationBag (a database table) for that user. Each UserMapAnnotationBag is associated with a single user and a single map.

## Output

### Calling the annotation report API

An API can be called which aggregates all of the UserMapAnnotationBags for the target map together. API calls are formatted as follows:

    https://staging.ecosystem.guide/api/annotations/report?map=<map_iri>

where `<map_iri>` is the IRI for the map you want the annotation report for (can be viewed in the Admin panel).

Note that the `map` parameter may be either the full IRI for a map -- for example, `http://visual-meaning.com/rdf/maps/eom-mgs-ds` -- or a shorthand form we are calling a qname. Qnames rely on the fact that for most IRIs the first chunk of an IRI is boilerplate from IRI to IRI -- in the example here the interesting part of the IRI (the qname) is the `maps/eom-mgs-ds` bit, while the preceding `http://visual-meaning/rdf/` part is uninteresting for the purposes of identifying a map.

So, instead of passing `http://visual-meaning/rdf/` as part of every map IRI, we can instead shorthand this part of the IRI by substituting `vm:` in its place. This means that calling

    https://staging.ecosystem.guide/api/annotations/report?map=vm:maps/eom-mgs-ds

is the same as calling

    https://staging.ecosystem.guide/api/annotations/report?map=http://visual-meaning/rdf/maps/eom-mgs-ds

The API may also be called with an optional `raw` parameter. The default output behaviour (see below) is to do some light aggregation so that each user's comments on a given stakeholder or painpoint are aggregated up into a single row with multiple comments. Passing `raw=true` to the API will disable this aggregation and output one row per comment.

    https://staging.ecosystem.guide/api/annotations/report?map=vm:maps/eom-mgs-ds&raw=true

A user must be logged in with an SMP user account to use this API. More granular permissions are planned, but not yet implemented.

### API output data format

Making a request to the annotation report API (or hitting it in a browser) will return a .csv formatted as follows:

| Commented By (email) | Comment | Category | Stakeholder/Painpoint | Stakeholder Name | Painpoint Name |
|----------------------|---------|----------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| joe.bloggs@example.com | Some comment text | Suprising | Painpoint | A stakeholder | A painpoint |

| Column name | What is it? |
|-------------|-------------|
| Commented By (email) | The email identity of the user leaving the comment. |
| Comment | The body of the comment text. If a user leaves multiple comments on the same object with the same category, these comments will be concatenated together into a single comment. |
| Category | The comment category (e.g "Surprising", "Interesting") |
| Stakeholder/Painpoint | Whether the comment was left on a stakeholder object ("Stakeholder") or a painpoint object ("Painpoint"). |
| Stakeholder Name | If the comment was left on a stakeholder, this is the human-parsable name of that stakeholder. If the comment was left on a painpoint, this is name of the parent stakeholder to the painpoint. |
| Painpoint Name | If the comment was left on a painpoint, this is the human-parsable name of that painpoint. If the comment was left on a stakeholder, this cell will be blank. |

## Questions:

Q: The MVP is an API that returns a dataset similar to that contained within the existing Powerpoint doc. Is this sufficient? 

A: *Yes, as MVP*.

Q: Users can currently make unlimited annotations. Is it necessary to limit the number of annotations which can be made so that feedback can be focused/prioritised? 

A: *No, it's fine for them to make as many annotations as they want*.

Q: Is being able to assign just a category to a painpoint (without associated comment) a necessary piece of functionality for this exercise? 

A: *Ideally the feedback process is as streamlined as possible (emoji-style), so the ability to leave it via a two- or three-click process of selecting a stakeholder/painpoint and then selecting a category without having to enter a full comment would be very nice.*
