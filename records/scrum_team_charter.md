# Visual Meaning Scrum Team Charter

## Things we always do

- Try to write the best code

- **Be kind**
  - Assume best intent
  - Bring humanity to work - full spectrum of emotion and acknowledgement that we are humans who do have personal lives
  - Reach out and be vulnerable

- **Commit**
  - Do what we say we will do (and communicate when things change)
  - Keep practical details front of mind
  - Prioritise team outcomes
  - Be meaningfully wrong

- **Collaborate**
  - Teach, share information and decisions, learning early and often and recording this where people can find the information again
  - Broadcast by default

- **Engage**
  - Engage in synchronous sessions
  - Thumbs up/down in response to questions in a group
  - Aim to ask questions first (curiosity, clean/clean-ish questions)
  - Never hesitate to express ourselves

## Things we never do

- **During delivery**
    - Land code without review
    - Hide information or code
    - Criticise the person instead of the code
    - Go it alone when doing something outside of your comfort zone
- **During communication**
    - Make assumptions about others' behaviour (other than best intent)
    - Bottle up frustrations without discussing them
    - Raise voices to each other
    - Be vague (share in a way others can't engage or disagree with)

## When and how do we raise issues / ask for help?

- **When**
    - When we'd like help
    - When we are ignorant and think someone else is better positioned to do something
    - When we are overwhelmed or unsure
    - When the exploration pauses or hits a dead end
- **How**
    - Raise during Daily Scrum/Retro/Teams thread
    - Inbox/call someone if raising publicly isn't appropriate
    - Share what we do know, what our opinion is, what we've already tried if applicable and point out what are unsure about/need help with.

## How do we make decisions?

- **Who**
    - Product Owner decides prioritisation on backlog, and has final say on acceptance criteria (with a LOT of input from others)
    - Developer working on a ticket makes implementation decisions not already clarified by rest of team, and seeks input where they need help
    - Input is always sought from discipline experts (Product, Development, UX, QA)
- **How**
    - Empirical, consensus-based decision-making - enough evidence is presented to reach one
    - Try things, inspect, gather feedback, adapt
    - With respect/reference to the real restrictions/contraints we face
    - With reference to product vision

## What do we do when the rules are broken?

- **Feedback and explore**
    - Hold each other accountable. Call out behaviour that doesn't align to charter.
    - Give clean feedback on what happened.
    - Get curious about why it happened - ask clean(ish) questions.
    - Expect introspection and accountability to be taken - and demonstrate that expectation through curiosity and give clean feedback

- Raise with performance coaches if resolving at source hasn't worked.

## How do we hold ourselves accountable?

- Peer accountability
- Admit our shortcomings
- Don't be afraid to display vulnerability
- Create a safe environment for transparency
- Meaningful apologies when we realise we've done wrong, and a clear commitment to what we will do differently next time.

- Metronomic retrospectives
- Rough consensus and running code
